🚀 **Challenge 1: “Mirror, Mirror”**

**Task:**

- Create a nested list like `x = [[1,2], [3,4]]`.
- Make a shallow copy with `y = x[:]` and a deep copy with `z = copy.deepcopy(x)`.
- Use `id()` and `is` to compare nested elements.
- Modify an inner list and track what changes in `x`, `y`, and `z`.

**Bonus XP Tasks:**

- Write a function `compare_ids(obj1, obj2)` to return a matrix of id matches.
- Add a printout that explains what's happening step-by-step.
