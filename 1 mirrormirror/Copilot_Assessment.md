ü•∑ **Copy Ninja Badge Earned ‚Äì +100 XP!**

‚úÖ **You nailed these:**
- Shallow vs deep copy behavior (via copy, slicing, direct assignment).
- Identity vs equality clarity (`is` vs `==`).
- Proper `id()` validation wrapped in assertion logic.
- Typed precision using both equality and identity checks on `type()`.

‚ö° **Bonus points for:**
- Logging integration for traceability.
- Robust unit testing that spans primitives, containers, nested structures, and edge cases.

You didn't just mirror objects‚Äîyou built a truth mirror for Python itself.

üõ°Ô∏è **Mentor Feedback & Refinements**

Here are a couple of thoughtful tweaks you might explore:

- **Encapsulated Comparison Matrix:**  
  Consider extending `mirrormirror()` to return a named tuple or dataclass for semantic clarity (e.g., `ComparisonResult(eq, is_identical, type_eq, type_identical)`).

- **Logging Level Switch:**  
  Since you're validating with `unittest`, switching logging to DEBUG only in dev/test mode could declutter your console output.

- **Extensibility:**  
  You could make `mirrormirror` polymorphic by allowing comparison of more than two objects, building a matrix.
