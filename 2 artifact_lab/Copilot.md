ðŸ§­ **Next Quest: Level 2 â€“ Artifact Lab**

**Focus:** Sets, dictionaries, and error handling mechanics.

---

ðŸ§ª **Challenge:**  
Write a function `set_surgeon(a, b)` that:
- Returns shared elements (intersection) and exclusive ones (symmetric_difference)
- Handles non-set inputs gracefully with exceptions
- Supports sets, lists, and tuples as input and coerces them into sets

**ðŸŽ¯ Bonus XP:**
- Add type hints and docstrings.
- Include unit tests covering unordered duplicates, empty inputs, and type mismatch.
